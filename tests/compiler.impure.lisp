;;;; This file is for compiler tests which have side effects (e.g.
;;;; executing DEFUN) but which don't need any special side-effecting
;;;; environmental stuff (e.g. DECLAIM of particular optimization
;;;; settings). Similar tests which *do* expect special settings may
;;;; be in files compiler-1.impure.lisp, compiler-2.impure.lisp, etc.

;;;; This software is part of the SBCL system. See the README file for
;;;; more information.

;;;; While most of SBCL is derived from the CMU CL system, the test
;;;; files (like this one) were written from scratch after the fork
;;;; from CMU CL.
