SYSTEM-SPECIFIC HINTS

for OpenBSD:
  It's reported for CMU CL (by Darren Bane on the comp.lang.lisp newsgroup,
  2002-04-22) that OpenBSD 3.0 has stricter ulimit values, and/or enforces
  them more strictly, than its predecessors, and so CMU CL's initial mmap()
  won't work unless you increase the limit on the data segment, e.g. with
    ulimit -S -d 524288
  before you run CMU CL. The same is probably true of SBCL, but hasn't been
  tested yet. (As of sbcl-0.7.3, SBCL has only been tested on OpenBSD 2.9
  and earlier.)
