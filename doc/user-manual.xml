    <para>This manual is maintained in SGML/DocBook, and automatically
    translated into other forms (e.g. HTML or TeX). If you're
    <emphasis>reading</emphasis> this manual in one of these non-DocBook
    translated forms, that's fine, but if you want to
    <emphasis>modify</emphasis> this manual, you are strongly advised to
    seek out a DocBook version and modify that instead of modifying a
    translated version. Even better might be to seek out
    <emphasis>the</emphasis> DocBook version (maintained at the time of
    this writing as part of <ulink url="http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/">the
    &SBCL; project</ulink>) and submit a patch.</para>
