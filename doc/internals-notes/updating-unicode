Updating Unicode versions (notes on the 10.0.0-12.1.0 update):

1. Download ucd.zip for the version to update to, along with UCA's
   allkeys.txt and CollationTest.zip, confusables.txt from security,
   and emoji-data.txt from emoji; replace all files in
   tools-for-build/ and tests/data/ with the corresponding versions.

   (See tools-for-build/update-unicode-datafiles.sh)

   a. obsolete: replaced by confusables.txt.  (think about
      ConfusablesEdited.txt which claims to be version 12: maybe
      that's the first version Confusables.txt existed?  Cross that
      bridge when we get to it.)

2. Look at the data files, and adjust more-ucd-consts.lisp-expr

   At least scripts are likely to have been added.

3. Try to build.

   (This didn't go wrong this time; there may be fewer hard-coded
   things than there were in the distant past.  I was slightly
   surprised that I adjusted more-ucd-consts.lisp-expr correctly first
   time.)

4. Run tests.  Expect failures:

   a. failures in unicode-properties.pure.lisp

      - a failure in :BIDI-CLASS might mean that the unallocated
        character properties have changed.  Look at
        DerivedBidiClass.txt and compare the ranges documented in the
        header with ucd.lisp `unallocated-bidi-class`.

      - failures in :GRAPHEME-BREAK-CLASS and :WORD-BREAK-CLASS come
        from the change in the breaking algorithm.  The major change
        comes from handling emoji in a more principled way, but this
        involves us needing to parse and preserve emoji data, so add
        emoji-data.txt from UTS 51.  There are also more minor
        changes: some characters added to the explicit list of
        :aletter in WORD-BREAK-CLASS, and the new :wsegspace class.
        Details in UAX 29.

   b. failures in unicode-breaking.pure.lisp

      - failures in :GRAPHEME-BREAKING / :WORD-BREAKING /
        :LINE-BREAKING comes from needing to update those breaking
        algorithms for the new classes, and the refinements they
        bring.  Grapheme- and word-breaking is in UAX 29;
        line-breaking is UAX 14.
