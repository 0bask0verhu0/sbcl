<chapter id="ffi"><title>The Foreign Function Interface</>

<para>FIXME: The material in the &CMUCL; manual about the foreign
function interface should be reviewed, reformatted in DocBook, 
lightly edited for &SBCL;, and substituted into this manual. But in
the meantime, the original &CMUCL; manual is still 95+% correct for
the &SBCL; version of the foreign function interface. (The main
difference is that the package names have changed from
<quote><literal>ALIEN</></> and <quote><literal>C-CALL</></> to
<quote><literal>SB-ALIEN</></> and <quote><literal>SB-C-CALL</></>.)
        <!-- FIXME: Oh, and I seem to remember that the CMUCL manual
	     was out of date about how to test for a null pointer,
	     there's a builtin operator to do it, you don't need to
	     do the nasty idiom the manual says you need to do. -->
	<!-- FIXME: Also, the CMU CL alien documentation claims you
	     can just do (DEFINE-ALIEN-VARIABLE "errno" INT), which fails
	     with modern multithreading hacks. -->
	<!-- FIXME: Also, LOAD-FOREIGN isn't implemented as of sbcl-0.6.7,
	     but LOAD-1-FOREIGN is. -->
