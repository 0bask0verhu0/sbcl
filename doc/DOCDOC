metadocumentation: hints for how to set things up so that the 
documentation gets processed correctly

WHN's approach:
  * (starting from Debian 3.0r1, in a configuration where 
    openjade-based toolchain for SGML DocBook was already present)
  * Use dselect to install everything plausible-looking which matches 
    the search string 'xsl': docbook-xsl, xsltproc, libxslt1.
  * (Now things work. This is probably in part because Kevin Rosenberg 
    already set up a suitable Debian configuration in the CVS files,
    so if you're on a system where there hasn't been done already -- i.e.
    system other than Debian or RedHat as of sbcl-0.8.6.1 -- you might
    need to add such a configuration yourself.)
