metadocumentation: hints for how to set things up so that the 
documentation gets processed correctly

WHN's approach:
  * (starting from Debian 3.0r1, in a configuration where 
    openjade-based toolchain for SGML DocBook was already present)
  * Use dselect to install everything plausible-looking which matches 
    the search string 'xsl': docbook-xsl, xsltproc, libxslt1.
  * (Now things work. This is probably in part because Kevin Rosenberg 
    already set up a suitable Debian catalog in the CVS files,
    so if you're on a system where there hasn't been done already -- i.e.
    system other than Debian or SuSE as of sbcl-0.8.6.1 -- you might
    need to add such a catalog file yourself. The catalog file is used
    to translate the URLs in the .xml and .xsl into local files. However,
    xsltproc should work fine and download the remote files if a catalog
    is no present on your system.)
