This manual is maintained in Texinfo, and automatically translated
into other forms (e.g. HTML or pdf). If you're @emph{reading} this
manual in one of these non-Texinfo translated forms, that's fine, but
if you want to @emph{modify} this manual, you are strongly advised to
seek out a Texinfo version and modify that instead of modifying a
translated version. Even better might be to seek out @emph{the}
Texinfo version (maintained at the time of this writing as part of the
SBCL project at @uref{http://sbcl.sourceforge.net/}) and submit a
patch.
