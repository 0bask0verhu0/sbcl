<para>This manual is maintained in SGML/DocBook, and automatically
translated into other forms (e.g. HTML or TeX). If you're

translated forms, that's fine, but if you want to <emphasis>modify</>
this manual, you are strongly advised to seek out a DocBook version
and modify that instead of modifying a translated version. Even
better might be to seek out <emphasis>the</> DocBook version
(maintained at the time of this writing as part of

and submit a patch.</para>
