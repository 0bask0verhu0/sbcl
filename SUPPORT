* Mailing lists

Your first recourse for support should probably be to the mailing list
  sbcl-help@lists.sourceforge.net

Remember that the people answering your question are volunteers, so
you stand a much better chance of getting a good answer if you ask a
good question: before sending mail, check
 
- the list archives, to check if your question has been answered already
   http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/forum.php?forum_id=4134   
 
    or (same list, different archive)
 
   http://news.gmane.org/gmane.lisp.steel-bank.general  
  
- the BUGS file, to see if we know about it.  Note that some of the 
  bugs in this file are old and it might be useful to have fresh reports, 
  in particular if you have new information that might help debugging

- advice on how to report bugs and ask questions that people want to
  answer

* Consultants

There is no formal organization developing SBCL, but if you need a
paid support arrangement or custom SBCL development, we maintain a
list of consultants in this file.  Use it to identify consultants with
appropriate skills and interests, and contact them directly.

The compilers of this file have made no attempt to verify the accuracy
of the information or the competence of the people listed: you must
make your own judgement of suitability from the available information
- refer to the links they provide, the CREDITS file, mailing list
archives, CVS commit messages, and so on.  Please feel free to ask for
advice on the sbcl-help list.
