;;; Save and restore dynamic environment.
;;;
;;; These VOPs are used in the reentered function to restore the appropriate
;;; dynamic environment.  Currently we only save the Current-Catch and binding
;;; stack pointer.  We don't need to save/restore the current unwind-protect,
;;; since unwind-protects are implicitly processed during unwinding.  If there
;;; were any additional stacks, then this would be the place to restore the top
;;; pointers.
