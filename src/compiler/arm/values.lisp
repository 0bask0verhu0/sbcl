;;; Push some values onto the stack, returning the start and number of values
;;; pushed as results.  It is assumed that the Vals are wired to the standard
;;; argument locations.  Nvals is the number of values to push.
;;;
;;; The generator cost is pseudo-random.  We could get it right by defining a
;;; bogus SC that reflects the costs of the memory-to-memory moves for each
;;; operand, but this seems unworthwhile.
