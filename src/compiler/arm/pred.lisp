;;;; The Branch VOP.

;;; The unconditional branch, emitted when we can't drop through to the desired
;;; destination.  Dest is the continuation we transfer control to.

;;;; Generic conditional VOPs

;;; The generic conditional branch, emitted immediately after test
;;; VOPs that only set flags.

;;; FIXME: Unlike the PPC (from whence this was cribbed), ARM actually
;;; has flags.  We should take advantage of them here.
