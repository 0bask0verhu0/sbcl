INTRODUCTION
============

The sb-aclrepl module offers an AllegroCL style Read-Eval-Print Loop for
SBCL. An AllegroCL style inspector is integrated. Adding an AllegroCL style
debugger is planned.

USAGE
=====
To start sb-aclrepl as your read-eval-print loop, execute the command
  (require 'sb-aclrepl)

You can also all this command to your ~/.sbclrc to have sb-aclrepl be the default REPL
for your SBCL sessions.

EXAMPLE ~/.sbclrc FILE
======================

(ignore-errors (require 'sb-aclrepl))

(when (find-package 'sb-aclrepl)
  (push :aclrepl *features*))

#+aclrepl
(progn
  (setq sb-aclrepl:*max-history* 100)
  (setf (sb-aclrepl:alias "asdc") #'(lambda (sys) (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op sys)))
  (sb-aclrepl:alias "l" (sys) (asdf:oos 'asdf:load-op sys))
  (sb-aclrepl:alias "t" (sys) (asdf:oos 'asdf:test-op sys))
  ;; The 1 below means that two characaters ("up") are required
  (sb-aclrepl:alias ("up" 1 "Use package") (package) (use-package package))
  ;; The 0 below means only the first letter ("r") is required, such as ":r base64"
  (sb-aclrepl:alias ("require" 0 "Require module") (sys) (require sys))
)
