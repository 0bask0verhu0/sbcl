This directory is for extensions to SBCL. They aren't necessary for
core SBCL functionality, or else they'd be built into the main SBCL
binary automatically. And they're not portable Common Lisp, or they'd
be put elsewhere (e.g. http://clocc.sourceforge.net/).

Some good candidates for future extensions here are:
  * bindings to existing foreign libraries (e.g. to a regexp library
    like PCRE, or to a compression library like zlib, or to a graphics
    library like Tk)
  * new libraries (e.g. a CORBA interface, or a port of the CMU CL
    POSIX functions, or a new higher-level POSIX functions)
  * low-level hooks into SBCL needed to interface it to some wrapper
    system (e.g. to interface to a graphical debugger of some sort)
  * a too-alpha-to-be-supported-yet tree shaker

SBCL extensions of less general interest, e.g. a binding to the C
interface of the Oracle RDBMS, or particularly large extensions, e.g.
big graphics frameworks, can also be associated with the SBCL project,
but instead of being included in this directory as part of the
distribution, they will be made available on the SBCL project web
site.
