o/~  Hey Mr Tambourine Man, play some -*- Text -*- for me   o/~

A semi-sane sockets interface for SBCL.  Usually also works in CMUCL, 
but is rarely actually tested there so may require some massaging

See INSTALL for prerequisites and build details

It uses the regression tester from the CMU AI repository.  This is
bundled in the file rt.lisp which is unchanged except where I added a
DEFPACKAGE form.  The tests themselves are in tests.lisp, and can be
run using the Makefile target intended for the purpose, or by
evaluating (rt:do-tests).  Note that one of the tests is an HTTP
client that connects back to ww.telent.net; if this bothers your
expectations of privacy, don't run it.

There is an automatically generated API reference in
api-reference.html which you can regenerate if you can figure out how
doc.lisp works.  You might find the examples in tests.lisp useful,
too.
